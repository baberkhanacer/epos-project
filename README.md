## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version x.x.x)
- Docker (version x.x.x)
- PostgreSQL (version x.x.x)
- Git (version x.x.x)

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

Use Git to clone the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/baberkhanacer/epos-project.git
cd epos-project
```

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Copy the example environment file and adjust the values
cp .env.example .env

# Make sure to set the DATABASE_URL and any other environment variables required for Node.js/Express.js and JWT 
```

#### Database Setup with Docker

User Docker to set up the PostgreSQL database. Ensure Docker is running before executing the following commands.

```bash
# Run PostgreSQL container
docker run --name epos-db -e POSTGRES_DB=epos -e POSTGRES_USER=youruser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

# Run migrations and seed the database (command depends on your migration tool)
npm run migrate
npm run seed
```

#### Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the frontend directory from the root of the project.

```bash
cd frontend

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend development server with Vite
npm run dev
```

The front-end should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Running the Backend Server

Return to the backend terminal window or tab.

```bash
# Start the Express server
npm start
```

The backend API server should be running on `http://localhost:5000` or your chosen port.

## Version Control with Git/GitHub

Ensure that you commit your changes and push to GitHub for version control.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Set up project structure"
git push origin main
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests for the frontend
npm test frontend

# Runt tests for the backend
npm test backend
```

## Deployment

After testing and ensuring that your application runs correctly, follow the specific guides for deploying to Heroku or AWS:

- [Heroku Deployment Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
- [AWS Elastic Beanstalk Node.js Deployment Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs.html)

Remember to set up environment variables and any necessary add-ons like Heroku Postgres or AWS RDS for your production database.

## Additional Configuration

For additional configuration, see the `config.js` file in the backend directory and `vite.config.js` in the frontend directory.
